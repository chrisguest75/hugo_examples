Recently I've been publishing a lot of example code on [Github](https://github.com/chrisguest75).  I use the examples for reference as `cheatsheet` like documentation.  They're also foundations that I build on when I'm trying out new ideas.  

Whether working with `Typescript`, `Docker`, `Bash`, `Terraform` or `Linux` I usually try to create small repeatable Proofs of Concept that I can refer back to or investigate features before productionising.  Doing this helps me play with the features, understand the technology to a greater depth and let me have a simplified point of reference for future work.  

Although not always to a consistent standard I regularly go back to the demos and update them as I walk through them on a new machine or OS.  Switching machines between different environments; Linux, MacOS, Raspian and Windows is a great learning experience to really understand how to create repeatable walkthroughs.  It also helps with creating a consistent environment; ZSH profile, VSCode extensions and other tooling such as; brew, nvm & tfenv.
